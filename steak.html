        <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</li>
        <li>2 Â½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness.
